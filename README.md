# docker-images

These are a few Dockerfiles that I use in my various development projects. They are all automatically built by the public Docker registry and can be found at https://hub.docker.com/u/wholroyd/. The folder names in this repository match the image names on the registry.

Docker images based on latest CentOS image for various programming projects

- NodeJS v0.12.7
